LEGAL WARNING
-------------
Connect to those nodes only that you're legally entitled to! Some examples (non exhaustive list):
* You can connect to a free, open source product; e.g. Open vSwitch.
* You CAN'T connect to a Cisco IOS (or any other commercia product) if you don't have a valid 
service contract; not even if the person runnning the lab has.

If you're unsure, ask the person running the lab. Connecting to nodes you're not entitled to may 
result breaking the law, which is an act of the user; the developer of this product can't take 
responsibility for any misuse of the product.
